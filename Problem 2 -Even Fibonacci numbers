#Even Fibonacci numbers
#Problem 2
#Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

x = 1
y = 2
total_even = 2
z = 0
print(x,y)

while z<4000000:
    z = x+y
    if(z%2==0): 
        total_even = total_even + z
        print(z, "is an even number. The cumulative total is:", total_even)
    else: (print(z))
    x = y
    y = z
    
print("Final total for even Fibonacci numbers less than 4 million is: ", total_even)


### cool simple code
a, b, var = 1, 2, 0
while True:
    if b % 2 == 0:
        var += b
    b += a
    a = b-a
    if b > 4000000:
        break
print("total is:",var)
